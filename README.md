# Unstable-Manifold
This project implements new methods for forming the Unstable Manifold of a Partial Differential Equation.  We make a change of coordinates by letting Theta = sigma * e^ (lambda * t), and by doing this, we can produce the manifold leaving in the direction of the eigenfunction.

Included in this project is a folder of core functions for producing the manifold as well as three complete example systems: Nagumo, Gray-Scott, and Shrodinger.  Saved Generated files are included with each example system so the homological equations don't have to be calculated every time the files are run.
